# Business Insights 360

This repository showcases the **Business Insights 360** Power BI project, designed to provide a comprehensive view into customer performance and product success across multiple dimensions. Through this project, I explored key metrics and performance indicators to support data-driven decision-making and enhance business outcomes.

## Project Overview
The **Business Insights 360** dashboard includes two primary analyses:

1. **Customer Performance**  
   Analyzed customer GM% achievements to evaluate whether each customer is meeting or falling short of set targets. This analysis assists in identifying areas of opportunity and aids stakeholders in understanding which customers may require targeted strategies for improvement.

2. **Top & Bottom 5 Product Analysis**  
   Focused on the top 5 countries, I determined the top 5 and bottom 5 products based on GM% growth Year-over-Year (YoY). Additionally, I tracked post-discount percentage trends for each customer, offering a clear view of product and pricing performance. This analysis empowers sales and marketing teams to optimize product portfolios based on performance.

## Key Learnings
Creating the **Business Insights 360** project allowed me to enhance my Power BI expertise, including:

- **Advanced Data Visualization**: Leveraged conditional formatting to highlight critical metrics, ensuring that insights are easily accessible and visually impactful.
- **Complex DAX Measures**: Developed complex DAX measures to calculate growth rates, apply filters, and display customer and product metrics accurately.
- **Data-Driven Storytelling**: Combined multiple data sources and used advanced analytical techniques to construct a narrative that supports business decisions.
- **Actionable Insights**: Translated raw data into actionable insights, providing clear recommendations and enabling stakeholders to make informed choices.

This project not only strengthened my technical skills in Power BI but also enhanced my ability to communicate insights effectively, ensuring that data-driven decisions are both strategic and impactful.
