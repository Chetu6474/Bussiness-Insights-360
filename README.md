## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

### Customer Performance Analysis
This segment of the dashboard focuses on evaluating customer GM% (Gross Margin Percentage) achievements to determine if customers meet, exceed, or fall below target thresholds. Insights from this analysis help pinpoint improvement opportunities and guide stakeholders in developing tailored strategies for customer engagement.

### Top & Bottom 5 Product Analysis
Highlighting the top 5 and bottom 5 products based on Year-over-Year (YoY) GM% growth across the top 5 countries, this analysis provides a clear perspective on product performance and pricing trends post-discounts. These insights are crucial for sales and marketing teams to refine product strategies and optimize the product portfolio.
